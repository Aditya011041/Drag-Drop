# Drag-Drop

i have completed all the required tasks:-

Requirements:

1. Implement a drag and drop functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Create two containers (e.g., div elements) side by side on the page.
3. Populate the first container with a list of items (e.g., images, text, or icons).
4. Allow users to drag and drop items from the first container to the second container.
5. Provide visual feedback during dragging (e.g., change the appearance of the dragged item).
6. When an item is dropped into the second container, display a success message or update the UI in any appropriate way.
7. Add a reset button to clear the second container and reset the first container to its original state.

and i have added some animation in the page when all the items from left box are dropped in right box. The screen flashes for a second.
i have also added a success message prompt when one item is dragged from left to right box.
i have also added the reset button with hover effect and it clears the 2nd box when clicked and resets the 1st container in its original state.
